          Example 2: Type in the name of the directory where you copied
                     the drivers, either on your local hard drive or
                     on a network share.

          Example 3: If you're not sure exactly where the drivers are,
                     choose the "Browse..." button are find them.

      Adapter that you have installed in your machine. 
      Read message and then click the "Next" button.

      Windows 98 will copy the display drivers to the proper directories
      on your system.

      When Windows 98 has finished copying the drivers, click the "Finish"
      button.
