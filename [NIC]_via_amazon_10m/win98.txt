Introduction:
=============

  This document shows you how to setup the driver and how to use the enhanced
  functions by setting the custom keywords.


Contents of the Subdirectory:
=============================

    PCIWNT.SYS          The NDIS3 driver for Windows 98.
    PCIW2K.INF          The installation information file.
    WIN98.TXT           This file.


Installation:
=============

  Before starting with the installation process, make sure that the adapter
  is properly installed and configured. You can use the diagnostic program
  (A:\SETUP.EXE) in DOS mode to make sure your connection with the network is
  correct.

    1. Turn the power of your PC on to boot from Windows 98. Windows 98 may
       auto-detect your new adapter installed, and the "New Hardware Found"
       dialogue box will appear. Select "Driver from disk provided by hardware
       manufacturer" to install driver from the diskette that come with your
       lan adapter.

       Note: If your new adapter is not detected by Windows 98, you can open
       "My Computer" -> "Control Panel" -> "Networks" after Windows 98 comes up,
       and select "Add adapter" -> "Have disk" to install driver from the
       diskette that come with your lan adapter.

    2. Insert the driver diskette into your floppy drive, and specify the
       path of the driver in the diskette(i.e. A:\WIN98) to copy the driver
       files to your system.

    3. When the driver installation is completed, restart Windows 98.


Configuration Parameters:
=========================
    Configuration:
    --------------
      1) Open "My Computer" -> "Control Panel" -> "Networks". Select "PCI
         Ethernet Adapter" from the Network Components list, and then click
         the "Properties" button.

      2) Click "Advanced" button, and you will see the following properties:
         EarlyReceive, EarlyTransmit, and FullDuplex. Turn the properties on
         if you want to enable the functions.

    Custom Properties:
    ------------------
        EARLYTRANSMIT                   This keyword is used to enable turbo
                                        transmission mode for accelerating data
                                        transmission.

        EARLYRECEIVE                    This keyword is used to enable turbo
                                        receiption mode for accelerating data
                                        receiption.
