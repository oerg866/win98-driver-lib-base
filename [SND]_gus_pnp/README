Thank you for choosing the UltraSound Plug & Play. Here is the last
minute information for these drivers:


Latest Drivers

The latest drivers for your UltraSound Plug & Play card are always
available for free download from the Gravis Web site www.gravis.com.


Plug & Play Problems
--------------------

The number 1 difficulty users have with installing the UltraSound
are resource conflicts. Plug & Play is supposed to allocate resources
without conflicts automatically. However many Plug & Play implementations
can not do this properly, especially when there are many devices installed
in the system. Your UltraSound effectively has the following 5 devices:

Synthesizer/CODEC (Music/Digital Sound Support)
Sound Blaster Emulation
MPU-401 General MIDI Emulation
ATAPI IDE CD-ROM Interface
Joystick/Game Port

Just disabling one of the above devices greatly reduces the chances
of conflicts occurring. If you are having resource conflicts you
should disable all devices you do not need. In particular most users
have no need for the IDE interface since they already have 2 IDE
interfaces in their system. You UltraSound may have even come with
the CD-ROM interface disabled.

To disable devices, run the supplied PNPCFG utility. To do this you must
be in DOS (Windows 95 users must restart in MS-DOS mode), then place the
driver disk in the drive and typing:

A:\PNPCFG <ENTER>

assuming the disk is in drive A:. From here on the program is fairly
self explanatory.

If you make any changes and are running Windows 95 we strongly recommend
you re-run the UltraSound driver SETUP after Windows 95 starts up again
as Windows 95 tends to become confused by these changes.

DOS/Windows 3.x users: Any changes you make with this utility will not show
up in the "Manual Setup" of the DOS/Windows 3.x Setup program. However if
you use the "Automatic Setup" option any changes made with PnPCfg will
take effect.


Sounds Looping in Windows
-------------------------

If you try and play a wave file and you find that part of the sound
plays over and over again, instead of playing the whole sound once,
your UltraSound is in conflict with another hardware device. You will
need to select a different IRQ.

For DOS/Windows 3.x, exit Windows and run SETUP from your UltraSound
directory. This will allow you to select a different IRQ for your
UltraSound Synth/CODEC device.

For Windows 95, start System Properties (Start->Settings->Control Panel,
System), select the Device Manager tab. If necessary, double click on
Sound, Video and Game Controllers to open it. You can then open the
UltraSound Synth/CODEC device and manually change its properties/resources.


More than one UltraSound Plug & Play in the Same Machine
--------------------------------------------------------

It is not possible to have more than one UltraSound Plug & Play card
in the same machine. The Plug & Play BIOS/Windows 95 will not be able
to separate the cards and the drivers are not designed to handle more
than one card.


IWSBOS (Sound Blaster Emulator) in a Windows 3.x/95 DOS BOX
-----------------------------------------------------------

IWSBOS works fine in a Windows DOS box, however you can not unload it from
within the DOS box. To unload it you must close the DOS box.


MIDI IN timing problems in Cakewalk
-----------------------------------

On some systems, recording from a MIDI keyboard, notes may become bunched
up together or note lengths may be incorrect. This issue is still under
investigation, however switching from a RAM based patch set to the ROM set
may correct the problem.


MIDI IN Crashing System
-----------------------

On a number of systems, if you have nothing plugged into the game/MIDI
port and try and use the MIDI in port, the system may crash. You can
overcome this problem by either plugging a joystick / gamepad / MIDI
keyboard into the port or configuring your application to not use the MIDI
IN port.


Exporting .PAT files with Sound Forge
-------------------------------------

You can not export wave files from Sound Forge in the Gravis .PAT format,
then run GIPC to convert them to the .FFF format. This is because you
can not edit important paramters such as envelope, loop points etc. from
within Sound Forge. You can load existing .PAT files which contain only a
single waveform and save out any changes you make to that waveform, however
this is of little use.


Changes since Version 2.0
-------------------------

* The gameport will now stay enabled when restarting Windows 95 in MS-DOS
  mode.

* The Windows 3.x properties page now fits on a 640x480 screen and comes
  up in the centre instead of partly off the screen.

* In the Windows 3.x drivers section of the control panel the UltraSound
  driver now has a proper description.

* On some systems, the properties page would appear, then immediately
  disappear. This has been corrected.

* Games that use DirectX 5 are now supported.

* Additions to this documentation.
