                  ---------------------------------------------
         Driver Installation for Microsfot Windows for Workgroups 3.11
         -------------------------------------------------------------

  Installation Procedure
  ----------------------
  The following installation procedure uses the FA312 as an exmple.
  The same installation procedure can be applied to the FA311 adapter.

  1.  In Program Manager, open "Network" -> "Network Setup" -> "Drivers".

  2.  In the "Network Drivers" window, select "Add Adapter".

  3.  When installing the LAN driver, Windows for Workgroups will present a
      list of all available drivers.  But the NETGEAR FA312 driver is
      not included in the system software.  Select "Unlisted or Updated 
      Network Adapter" for 3rd party adapters not in the driver list.

  4.  Windows for Workgroups will ask for the drive/directory path con-
      taining the FA312 driver.  Provide the path to the OEMSETUP.INF file
      in the \WFW311 directory.

        eg. A:\WFW311 when installing from the provided driver disk.

      Windows for Workgroups should copy the appropriate driver to the
      Windows for Workgroups system.

  5.  Select the "NETGEAR FA311/FA312 PCI Adapter".
    
      At this point, the driver has been properly copied and the
      installation would proceed to the next step.  Please refer to your
      Windows for Workgroups installation guide for the correct procedures.

      After the initial installation, the FA312 drivers will be
      permanently installed into the Windows for Workgroups system.
      Subsequent accesses to the network driver list will include these
      drivers as options.
