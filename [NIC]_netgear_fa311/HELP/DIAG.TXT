                          Diagnostic Program
                          ------------------

  Introduction
  ------------
  The diagnostics program allows you to verify the configuration and 
  isolate any fault condition on the adapter card.
  

  Getting Started
  ---------------
  The Diagnostic Program DIAG.EXE is provided in the root directory of the
  driver diskette.  No decompresstion is necessary prior to the program
  execution with the following procedure.

  1.  Insert the Drivers and Diagnostics disk and type A:\DIAG to
      execute the Diagnostic program. 

        eg. A:\DAIG

  2.  The Diagnostic Program lets you view the current adapter configuration:

        Viewed items: Your Current Configuration
              <1> Node ID
              <2> Bus Mode
              <3> Card Type
              <4> Connnector Type
              <5> I/O Base Address
              <6> Interrupt Number

        If the Node ID appearing on the screen does not begin with
        "004005" or "00A0CC", the adapter card may not be configured
        correctly by the system BIOS.  Check with the "PnP OS" setting
        on the system BIOS and make sure that it is set to "OFF".

        The test cannot continue correctly if the node ID is read incorrectly.

  3.  Performs the tests that can isolate the network problem:

        Performs test items: Setup Configuration
              <1> Serial ROM Test
              <2> Controller Internal Loopbak Test
              <3> Twister Layer Internal Loopbak Test
              <4> Network Connection Test
            
             Serial ROM Test
             ---------------
             This test read and verifies the content of the Serial ROM.
             The test fails if the adapter configuration data keep in the
             Serial ROM returns with a bad checksum, meaning
             the adapter may not be programmed propery, or damaged
             serial ROM.

             Controller Internal Loopbak Test
             --------------------------------
             In this test, traffic is generated at the rate of 100Mbps or 
             10Mbps, packets are being interrupted and reflected at the 
             MAC level without reaching the network cable. A FAIL test
             result represents a faulty Ethernet Controller.
                 
             Twister Layer Internal Loopbak Test
             -----------------------------------
             In this test, traffic is generatted at the rate of 100Mbps,
             packets are begin interrupted and reflected at the MAC level
             and sent to the Twister layer then back to the Controller
             without reaching the network cable. A FAIL test result 
             represents a faulty Ethernet Twister.

             Network Connection Test
             ----------------------- 
             This test verifies the media connection status. A FAIL result
             indicates bad network connection. Please check your twisted-
             pair cable connection to the cable.
