                  ---------------------------------------------

  Introduction
  ------------
  Thank you for purchasing the NETGEAR Model FA312 or the Model FA311
  Fast Ethernet PCI adapter.  These two adapter cards have been developed
  by combining the latest 100BASE-TX Fast Ethernet technology and
  peripheral component interface (PCI) local bus technology.

  Additionally, the NETGEAR Model FA312 supports Wake-on-LAN feature
  in Windows 2000, allowing the system with a FA312 adapter card to be
  remotely configured.  The Model FA312 adapter card supports PCI rev 2.1
  systems which requires a 3-pin connector for system wake-up as well as
  PCI rev 2.2 system which can be awakened by the PME# signal on the PCI
  bus.
