Installation:
=============

  Before starting with the installation process, make sure that the adapter
  is properly installed and configured.

    1. Turn on the power of your PC on to boot from Windows operating system.
       Windows will auto-detect your new adapter, and the "New Hardware Found"
       dialogue box will appear. Select "Driver from disk provided by hardware
       manufacturer" to install driver from the diskette that comes with your
       LAN adapter.

    2. Insert the driver diskette into your floppy drive, and specify the
       path of the driver in the diskette(i.e. A:\) to copy the driver
       files to your system.

    3. When the driver installation is completed, restart Windows if needed.

  Note:

    1. On some machines, it is possible that some NICs fail to initialize.
       This might be caused by insufficient memory. Users can try to decrease
       Tx or Rx buffer number to solve this problem.

    2. The Flow Control setting "Hardware Default (Auto)" means the flow control
       ability depends on the auto-negotiation result with the link partner.
       In other settings ("Enable Tx", "Enable Rx", "Enable Tx/Rx"), driver will
       set the Tx or Rx flow control ability without auto-negotiation.
