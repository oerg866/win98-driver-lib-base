Introduction:
=============

  This document shows you how to use the diag32 utility.


Contents of the Subdirectory:
=============================

    DIAG32.EXE            The diag32 utility program file.
    DIAG32.TXT            This file.


Usage:
======

    The diag32 menu consists of four functions:

    1.  I/O Base Address
        I/O base address is assigned by PCI BIOS and can not be modified.

    2.  Interrupt Output Line
        Interrupt is assigned by PCI BIOS and can not be modified.

    3.  Connection Type
        The physical media currently you had connected.

    4.  Boot ROM 
        You can select Boot ROM 64K/FlashROM or No Boot ROM.
        Boot ROM base address is assigned by PCI BIOS and can not be modified.

    5.  Ethernet Address
        Ethernet MAC address of this card.

    6.  Chip Type
        Chip type of this card.

    7.  Host Interface
        Host interface of this card.

    8.  PCI-X compatible
        Compatible with PCI-X or not.
        If the Host Interface is 32-bit only, then no this item.



Key definition:
===============

    F1      Help screen.
    F3      PHY test.
    F4      Change boot ROM size.
    F5      Diagnose this network adapter.
    F6      Network test in Master/Slave mode.
    F7      WOL test in Link on/off or Waker/Sleeper mode.
    F8      Change connection type.
    F10     Select to be compatible with PCI-X or not.
            If the Host Interface is 32-bit only, then no this item.

NOTE:
=====

    1. Please do not use EMM386.EXE in the DOS CONFIG.SYS file. It will cause diag32.exe
       to generate page fault exception.
