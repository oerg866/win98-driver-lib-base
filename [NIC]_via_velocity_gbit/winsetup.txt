    The Windows setup program will search the information file automatically in 
Windows 95/95OSR2/98SE/ME/2000/XP/Server 2003 ("OEMSETUP.INF" in Windows NT4), 
and then automatically install/update driver according to the information file. 
The information file search paths are current directory, upper directory and 
root directory by order.

      adapter driver on Windows 9X platfoms and reboot without any prompt.

      A:\>winsetup -d C:\FETWIN\ -w C:\WIN9X\ -b

    2.REMOVE

      The following instruction will remove all recognized network adapter drivers.

      A:\>WinUinst

      If you placed the driver files on C:\FETWIN\, the following instruction will 
      only remove network adapter driver specified in the driver inf file.

      A:\>winsetup -r -d C:\FETWIN\
