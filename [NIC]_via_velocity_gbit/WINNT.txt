Installation:
=============

  Before starting with the installation process, make sure that the adapter
  is properly installed and configured.

    1. Open "Control Panel" -> "Networks", and choose the "Add Adapter" button.
       The Add Noetwork Adapter dialog box appears.  Select "<other> Requires
       disk from manufacturer" in the list of Network Adapters, and then press
       <Enter>.

    2. Insert the driver diskette into your floppy drive, and specify the
       path of the driver in the diskette(i.e. A:\) if necessary.

    3. Select the correct Adapter, and start to copy the driver files to your
       system.

    4. After all the driver files have been copied to your system, a property
       dialog box appears in the screen. You can enable the special properties
       if you want to.

    5. When the driver installation is completed, restart your PC.

  Note:

    1. The Flow Control setting "Hardware Default (Auto)" means the flow control
       ability depends on the auto-negotiation result with the link partner.
       In other settings ("Enable Tx", "Enable Rx", "Enable Tx/Rx"), driver will
       set the Tx or Rx flow control ability without auto-negotiation.
