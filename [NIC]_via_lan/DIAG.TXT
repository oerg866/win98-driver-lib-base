Introduction:
=============

  This document shows you how to use the diag utility.


Contents of the Subdirectory:

    DIAG.TXT            This file.


Usage:
======

    The diag menu consists of four functions:

    1.  I/O Base Address
        I/O base address is assigned by PCI BIOS and can not be modified.


    2.  Interrupt Output Line
        Interrupt is assigned by PCI BIOS and can not be modified.


    3.  Connection Type
        The physical media currently you had connected.


    4.  Boot ROM 
        You can select Boot ROM 64K/FlashROM or No Boot ROM.
        Boot ROM base address is assigned by PCI BIOS and can not be modified.


    5.  Ethernet Address
        Ethernet MAC address of this card.


    6.  Chip Type
        Chip type of this card.


Key definition:
===============

    F1      Help screen.
    F4      Change boot ROM size.
    F5      Diagnose this network adapter.
    F6      Network test in Master/Slave mode.
    F7      WOL test in Link on/off or Waker/Sleeper mode.
    F8      Change connection type.


Command line usage:
===================

    Command line syntax:
