            0   Auto select link change interrupt (default).
            1   Link change is triggered by the PHY interrupt.
            2   Link change is determined from the link ready signal.
            3   Link change is determined by auto-polling.  (5701 only)

            The default mode for 5700 is "1" and 5701 is "2".

        "LinkChngMode"
            0   Auto select the mechanism for determining link change status.
            1   Look at the MAC status register to get link change status.
            2   Look at the status block for link change status.  (5701 only).

            The default mode for 5700 is "1" and 5701 is "2".

        "Bcm540xMode"
            0   Auto select 540x LED mode based on the device's subsystem IDs.
            1   540x LED mode is set to "Triple Speed".
            2   540x LED mode is set to "LINK10".

    On the 5701, the status block size is configured to 80, 64, or 32 bytes 
    long depending on the number of rings enabled.

    Modified code to adjust the start of a receive buffer so that the payload
    will align at a 4-byte boundary.

    Changed the severity of link down event message log to "Information"
    instead of "Error".

    Modified the driver to not log "Informational" messages to the EventViewer
    during initialization.  On a Windows 9x system, this will cause an
    undesirable error message box to popup after the system boots up.  This
    version of the driver will not log "Driver initialized successfully"
    message and link information during initialization.

    Fixed system crash caused by running cable diagnostic in heavy traffic.


1.27        01/22/01

    Fixed intermitten crash on Whistler when entering lower power mode.  This
    was cause by the driver copying network wake-up frame beyond the give
    buffer.

    Added a workaround for the problem with not being able to DMA buffers that
    end at 0xfffffff8-0xffffffff address region.

    Driver will not switch to the auxilliary power if the system does not have
    it.

    Disallowed receiving packets bigger than 1514 but less than 1536 when
    jumbo frame is not enabled.

    Maximum jumbo frame size was changed from 8000 to 9000 bytes in b57nt4.hlp.


1.26        01/02/01

    Changed the way DPC is being serialized.

    Increased the maximum jumbo frame size to 9k.

    Added code to reset the PHY and wait for link during initialization.

    Fixed 1c_ofld.tst failure when only the transmit checksum is enabled.

    Restore PCI subsystem and subvendor IDs on a reset.

    
1.25        12/22/00

    Added support for the B1 silicon.

    Fixed no link up interrupt.

    Fixed intermitten W2k system hang on boot up when there is no cable
    connected with Netbuei and Nwlink protocol installed.

    Modified b57w2k.inf to enable WOL and TX checksum offloading capabilities.

    Improved driver performance.


1.24        12/16/00

    Fixed problem with link functuation when coming out of hibernation mode.

    Fixed possible memory leak due to transmit packet descriptor not being
    freed up when the driver unloads.

    Cosmetic changes to oemsetup.inf and b57w2k.inf.

    Added code to check for subsystem vendor Id.


1.23        12/11/00

    Fixed an intermitten system crash when unloading the driver on a busy
    network.


1.22        12/09/00

    Fixed 1c_gtime failure when forcing 10mb full duplex on an HP 2424M switch.


1.21        12/07/00

    Shorten "Link Selection" items in b57w2k.inf and oemsetup.inf.

    Added software workaround to recover from link mismatch settings.  For
    example, the link partner is forced to 100mb and the adapter is forced
    to 10mb.


1.19        12/04/00

    Replaced "Driver" with "Controller" in b57w2k.inf and oemsetup.inf.

    Fixed a very intermitten MAC and PHY loopback failure.


1.18        12/01/00

    Removed TxMtu configurable parameter.  Now the user only has to configure
    RxMtu to enable jumbo frame support.

    5401 B0 silicon was not being resetted when the 1gb link went down.  The
    reset is required as software workaround for the 5401 errata.

    Driver will now restore a couple of PCI configuration registers after
    a reset.


1.17        11/29/00

    Added the ability to configure jumbo frame parameter in the b57w2k.inf.

    Fixed driver reporting wrong link status after reboot when forcing
    link speed on both sides.

    Fixed failure in MAC loopback test.


1.16        11/28/00

    Updated the 5401 tap power-management script.

    Removed the busy polling for link when unplugging the cable.  The polling
    period was too long and it was causing BASP to drop some Chariot
    connections.

    Removed support for A0, A1 silicon to reduce code size.


1.15        11/26/00

    Fixed intermitten system lock-up on shutdown when WOL is enabled.

    Multicast table was never cleared which was causing the intermitten
    failure in 2c_rmult.

    5401 reset on link down should occur only when the current speed is 1gb.

    Reduced driver load/unload time which will eliminate the 1c_gtime warnings.
    However, these warnings may still occur when WOL is enabled.  This is due
    to the driver waiting for auto-negotiation to complete before completing
    initialization.


1.14        11/22/00

    Added a software workaround for the 5401 to prevent it from locking up
    when the cable is unplugged during transmission.

    All the LEDs now indicate their corresponding link speed.

    
1.13        11/21/00

    Fixed problem with TCP connections dropping when running Chariot in
    10/100mb mode.

    Fixed problem with the adapter being disabled after exiting from the
    standby mode in Windows 2000.

    Fixed problem with the adapter not entering into wake-up mode when
    "shutdown".

    Ignore TX checksum parameter for B0 silicon.


1.12        11/18/00

    Added WOL support for Windows 2000.

    Fixed intermitten lock-up in 10mb mode.  Shadowed several MAC registers.

    Fixed PHY register read problem.  Occasionally PHY register read returned
    an incorrect value.

    Default TaskOffload and FlowControl parameter to off.


0.9         11/10/00

    Added MagicPacket support.

    In v0.8, whenever the driver detects a link mismatch, it will recover
    by switching to auto-negotiation mode.  This version does not have this
    recovery mechanism.

    Write the link settings to the EventLog after the driver has initialized.

    Fixed 1c_gtime failure when forcing line speed.


0.8         11/03/00

    NdisPacket allocated by the driver did not have the protocol reserved
    area which could cause system crash.

    Added a better handshaking mechanism with the firmware.

    Fixed the 2m_addres test.

    Added Compaq Hot Plug PCI support in oemsetup.inf.

    The MAC was not properly setup to operate in half duplex mode.

    Modified the driver to receive maximum sized VLAN packet without using
    the Jumbo receive ring.


0.7         10/30/00

    Fixed problems with forcing line speed.  

    Added checksum offloading capability.

    Fixed several issues with the Ndis test.  The following test should
    pass now:  1c_ofldn, 2m_load, 2m_misc, 2m_addre.

    Added support for IBM hot plug.


0.6         10/22/00

    Fixed lock-up that occurs when running the Ndis stress test.

    Fixed system crash when stopping the driver on an A1 silicon.

    Minor changes in b57nt4.hlp.

    Fixed problems with PHY loopback.  Added support for MAC loopback.

    Added a vendor specific OID for changing the MAC address.
    
    Tested VLAN tagging and 802.1p priority packet.


0.5         10/17/00

    Added a timer routine to periodically program the hardware to update
    the status block and generate an interrupt.  This is necessary because
    with A0, A1, B0 silicon, under certain condition, the host will miss
    interrupts.

    Disable PCI NWI by default.

    The send producer index is written twice.  This is a bug in the A0, A1, B0
    silicon in which chip will miss the mailbox stimulus.

    Added tx/rx PAUSE frame negotiation with link partner.  Modified b57w2k.inf
    to allow the user to configure rx/tx PAUSE frame independently.

    Fixed VLAN bug.  The driver was retrieving VLAN tag from the wrong offset
    in the miniport reserved area.

    Added jumbo frame support.  The user must manually modify the registry
    parameter to enable this feature.  "RxJumboDescCnt" must be changed
    to some value greater than 20 but less than 256.  This value determine
    the numbe of receive buffers to allocate for jumbo frames.

    Modified oemsetup.inf and b57w2k.inf to default "DisableAutoNeg" to 1,
    which will disable auto-negotiation advertisement when selecting a
    particular line speed.

    Added a help file for b57nt4.sys driver.


0.04        10/02/00
    Added support for link change detection via PHY interrupt as oppose to
    having the MAC poll the PHY.  PHY interrupt processing can be enable
    via "UsePhyInterrupt" registry parameter.  Default is "auto-polling".

    Miscellaneous modifications oemsetup.inf and b57w2k.inf.  Also fixed
    driver update issues with oemsetup.inf.

    Added delay before the driver is unloaded to prevent W2K from detecting
    the card as a different device.

    Fixed the deserialized driver to queue outgoing packets when there is no
    more packet descriptors left.


0.03        09/21/00
    Modified reset and halt routines to handle shutdown more robustly.  Some 
    systems will not recognize the board after a warm boot.  This version
    of the driver should fix this.

    
0.02        09/09/00
    Initial release for the A1 silicon.
