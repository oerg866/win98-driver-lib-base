Installation Procedure:

    - When LAN drivers is installed, Windows for Workgroups will present
      a list of all available drivers. Since there will be no DFE-530TX
      drivers initially, select UNLIST for 3rd party adapters not in
      the driver list.

    - Windows for Workgroups will ask for the drive/path containing
      the DFE-530TX driver. Type the following:

            <CD drive>:\WFW311   ;(Assume driver locate at A drive)

    - Windows for Workgroups will attempt to locate an OEMSETUP.INF file
      in the specified path. If you have entered the path name correctly,
      Windows for Workgroups should copy the appropriate drivers to the
      Windows for Workgroups system.

    - At this point, the driver would have been properly copied and the
      installation would proceed to the next step.  Please refer to your
      Windows for Workgroups installation guide for correct procedures.

    - After the initial installation, the DFE-530TX drivers will be
      permanently copied to the Windows for Workgroups system.
      Subsequent network driver lists will already contain DFE-530TX
      drivers.
