//
// INSTALL on-line Help Text File
//
// Help Customization Guidelines:
//
// 0) Comment lines start with leading '//'.
// 1) Help Message Text starts with #MESSAGE statement
// 2) Never change the number after the #MESSAGE statement. That is
//    the search Message ID for the INSTALL program.
// 3) LINES statement defines how many (lines) x (characters) allowed.
//    Never exceed this limits when you type the text for the message.
// 4) TITLE statement defines the sub-Title of this message.
//    (allow to modify for your customization)
// 5) Text area starts and ends with a '$'.
//    (allow to modify for your customization)
// 6) the INSTALL program is not going to format your
//    text. It just show whatever text you typed here
//    line by line. So you have to do the formatting for
//    better effect and please use SPACEs but not TABs.
//    (you don't need to enter trailing SPACE lines. If there is space
//     left at the bottom of a HELP message, white space is the default.)
// 7) Anyway, give a try and see how it goes.
//
// 9) Format Overview (example)
//
//    #MESSAGE = 1			   // starts Help message 1
//    TITLE="Selcet CD-ROM Type"        // sub-title of this message
//    LINES=9x50			// allowed text area:
//					// 9 lines x 50 characters
//    $ 				// starts text area
//    TEXT LINEs
//    TEXT """"                         // help text
//    " " "
//    $ 				// end of text area
